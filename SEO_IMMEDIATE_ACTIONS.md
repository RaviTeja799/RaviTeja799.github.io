## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use your full name everywhere**: "Ravi Teja Bhagavatula" is easier to rank than just "Ravi Teja"

2. **Be consistent**: Post regularly on social media

3. **Engage with community**: Comment, like, share others' content

4. **Quality over quantity**: One good article > 10 mediocre posts

5. **Track everything**: Use Google Search Console to see what's working

## ⚠️ Reality Check

**"Ravi Teja" alone is VERY competitive** because of:

- Telugu actor Ravi Teja (extremely famous)
- Thousands of other people with same name

**Better strategy**:
