KEY PROJECTS
Android GNSS Logger with Collision Detection (SIH)
● An Android app for ISRO to log raw GNSS/IMU data and prevent vehicle collisions in real-time.
● Engineered a real-time collision detection system using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion, achieving 5-10m
position accuracy.
● Implemented a low-latency (20-50ms) P2P vehicle communication system using UDP Multicast,Bluetooth(BLE) for automatic
device discovery and data sharing.
● Designed a multi-level warning system (visual, audio, vibration) to alert users about collision risks based on probabilistic risk
assessment.
● Tech Stack: Kotlin (Native Android), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), UDP Multicast, CSV.
CivicVoice: Full-Stack Civic Reporting Platform (SIH)
● A comprehensive web and mobile platform for citizens to report local issues, track status, and engage with government
workflows.
● Architected a full-stack solution with a React frontend, Express backend, and Firebase for auth and real-time notifications
(FCM).
● Implemented key server-side modules for gamification (points, leaderboards) and report status tracking (SLA, escalations).
● Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM), TypeScript, SQLite.
AI Health Symptom Checker (IBM AI and Cloud Virtual Internship)
● An intelligent chatbot developed during the Edunet IBM AI & Cloud Internship to analyze symptoms and provide health
information.
● Utilized the Mistral 70b large language model to power the core conversational and analytical engine.
● Deployed the application on IBM Cloud, gaining hands-on experience with cloud-based AI services and model integration.
● Tech Stack: Python, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson, Mistral 70b, AI/ML.
AI Garbage & Recyclables Detection (Mini Project)
● An AI-powered web and mobile application to automatically classify 30 different types of garbage and recyclable materials from
images.
● Trained and deployed a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device
inference.
● Separately developed a native Android version of the classifier using Kotlin, demonstrating cross-platform deployment skills.
● Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow Lite, CNN, Kotlin (Native Android), Pillow.
